<sub>Total Injectors: **120**</sub>

A website where you can easily look up battery offset data for common automotive injectors.

Don't waste your time digging through a company's website or trying to find the sheet that came with the box.

## Usage

Injectors are searchable by _Brand_, _Description_, _Capacity_ and _Ohms_/_Impendance_.

Cards are hoverable on a computer and clickable on a mobile device.

Just click on either the _voltage_ or _injection time_ values to copy them to your _clipboard_.

Clicking on the Capacity will convert the values between _cc/min_ and _lb/hr_.
